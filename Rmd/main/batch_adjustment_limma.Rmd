### Limma batch correction

To see what the effect of including batch in our limma model is, we will fit a
linear model using only batch and visualize the residuals of the model.

```{r}
batch_design <- model.matrix(~batch)

# If voom is enable, redo with batch design
if (use_voom) {
    # voom data
    norm_method <- ifelse(quantile_normalize, 'quantile', 'none')

    batch_voom <- voom(exprs(counts$raw), batch_design,
                       normalize.method=norm_method,
                       plot=CONFIG$include_plots)

    # Create a linear model for batch and get residuals
    batch_fit <- lmFit(batch_voom, design=batch_design)
    
    # same as residuals(batch_fit, batch_voom)
    limma_residuals <- residuals(batch_fit, batch_voom$E)
} else {
    batch_fit <- lmFit(counts$normed, design=batch_design)
    limma_residuals <- residuals(batch_fit, exprs(counts$normed))
}

# store batch-adjusted counts
exprs(counts$batch_adjusted) <- limma_residuals
```
